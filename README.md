# Canada-Inflation-Forecasting

* Inflation Forecasting is important for economic analysis, policy-making, and decision support.
* These insights hold particular significance for the Bank of Canada, as policymakers closely monitor inflation forecasts to guide decisions on interest rates.
* The central goal of maintaining inflation at 2% underscores the relevance of accurate forecasts for effective monetary policy.

* Our study focuses on forecasting the inflation rate in Canada using various time series models, including the ARIMA model, Neural Network Auto regression model, Standard Regression, and Dynamic Regression model. We also proposed a hybrid model that combines the strengths of dynamic regression and neural networks, harnessing the explanatory power of regression models and the adaptability of neural networks.
* As we know there are various factors which decides inflation of any country. Our project utilizes unemployment rate and exchange rates to predict inflation of the Canada.
* The primary objective is to compare the performance and accuracy of these models to identify the best-fit model for forecasting inflation in Canada.
* The initial phase involves employing ARIMA models to capture the temporal patterns inherent in the inflation and Neural network model to capture complex structures. Subsequently, standard regression models provide insights into the linear relationships between these variables. Simultaneously, dynamic regression models account for potential external influences, offering a more nuanced understanding of the intricate dynamics shaping inflation.
* To assess the models, evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are employed.
* The hybrid model outperformed all models in forecasting Canada's inflation.
